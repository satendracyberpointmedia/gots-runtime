# GoTS Standard Library

This directory contains the TypeScript standard library for the GoTS runtime.

## Structure (Planned)

stdlib/
  core/   - Core runtime functions
  http/   - HTTP client/server
  fs/     - File system operations
  crypto/ - Cryptography
  util/   - Utilities

## Status

This is a placeholder. The actual standard library will be implemented later.
This directory must exist for the runtime to start correctly.
